This extension allows you to modify your browser "user-agent" string to a custom designation, making it impossible for websites to know specific details about your browsing arrangement.

Notes:
1. You can easily set custom "user-agent" strings from the toolbar popup
2. The extension uses a two-factor technique to mimic your default "user-agent" string, which is the most reliable method
3. The extension does not use any resources when it is not spoofing the user-agent
4. The extension enables user-agent spoofing on specific domains only; it is conversely possible to exclude certain domains from spoofing. Check the Options page for more info.
5. You can set per-site user-agent strings
6. There is an option to randomize user-agent strings.
7. It is possible to set the user-agent string for a single-window; you can have a separate user-agent string for each browser window
8. This extension supports managed storage so that preferences can be altered automatically or can be pre-configured by a domain administrator
