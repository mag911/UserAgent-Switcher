# Firefox User Agent Switcher
A User Agent switcher browser extension for Firefox!

------------
This extension is able to alter both the user-agent's request header and the navigator related properties (e.g.: `navigator.userAgent`, and `navigator.appVersion`). You can mimic by hostname / window / container (Firefox only), or randomly from an array.
